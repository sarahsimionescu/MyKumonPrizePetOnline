# MyKumonPrizePetOnline
A full MERN web app I created to encourage students at my local kumon center to complete their homework! This is the updated version of last year's Java program.

Two options:
1. Use serverless version hosted by MongoDB (with-mongodb-serverless) locked by a secret that is returned when the admin (kumon intructor) provides a password
2. Use local node.js server (with-node.js-backend) that connects to the MongoDB database through a secure username and password
